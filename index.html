  <h1> Skin care</h1>

  <p> 
    Skin care or skincare is a range of practices that support skin integrity, enhance its appearance <br>
    , and relieve skin conditions
    <br>. They can include nutrition,
    <br> avoidance of excessive sun exposure
    <br>, and appropriate use of emollients
    <br> Practices that enhance appearance include the use of cosmetics,
    <br> botulinum, exfoliation, fillers, laser resurfacing, microdermabrasion, peels, retinol therapy,[1] and ultrasonic skin treatment.[2] Skin care is a routine daily procedure in many settings, such as skin that is either too dry or too moist, and prevention of dermatitis and prevention of skin injuries.[3]

    Skin care is a part of the treatment of wound healing, radiation therapy and some medications.
